Hi, I’m @AnthonyChang

I’m interested in writing applications, building computers, mining and trading cryptocurrencies, 3D printing, video games, video production, photography, audio equipment, and playing music.

I’m currently learning to write video games in Unity Game Engine.

You can find me on GitHub @AnthonyChang, TwitchTV @MrAnthonyChang, Instagram @tchangarang, and YouTube @TonyChangGaming.
